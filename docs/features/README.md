# Summary

`pls` provides many features over classic `ls` command, and even its various
replacements over the years.

- `pls` shows pretty and useful [icons](./icons) next to file and folder names.

- `pls` extensively uses [colors](./colors) in the interface for both node names
  and metadata.

- `pls` classifies files by [importance](./importance) and highlights or subdues
  their appearance accordingly.

- `pls` can [filter](./filtering) nodes in or out, by their types and by regex
  comparisons of their names.

- `pls` can [sort](./sorting) files using 10 different attributes, in both
  directions, including the option of showing directories first.

- `pls` has a [details](./details) view that can list 12 additional fields along
  with the node name, including a developer favourite Git status.

- `pls` can [collapse](./collapse) or hide autogenerated files behind their
  handwritten counterparts to reduce clutter.

- `pls` uses [suffixes](./suffixes) to depict the type of the node such as `/`
  for directories and `|` for FIFO pipes.

- `pls` allows you to customise and modify every single feature listed above
  using straightforward [config files](../reference/configuration).

We're also working on a number of [enhancements and new features](./upcoming).
So stay tuned!
