  some of the ideas that we are working on to improve pls.

# Upcoming

In addition to its [many existing features](./summary), we have bold plans for
the future of `pls`. Soon, `pls` will be able to do all the following.

- `pls` will add more spec-matching criteria to make the specs much more
  granular and fine-tuned.

  - MIME type
  - globs
  - path relative to Git

- `pls` will allow a more nuanced conditional approach for specs such as
  combining identification methods with `and`/`or`.

- Specs should also get a specificity/priority setting to be able to override
  the specs above them.

- `pls` will be able to generate `tree`-like output recursively for
  subdirectories.

- `pls` will be able to parse `.gitignore` for importance rules and two-letter
  Git statuses for a simpler notation.

If you have more ideas to improve the functionality of `pls` or want to help
implement any of these features, please submit a PR. `pls` is free and
open-source software that could use [your help](../contributing).
