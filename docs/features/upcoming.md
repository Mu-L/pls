# Upcoming

We have bold plans for the future of `pls`. Soon, `pls` will be able to

- add more spec-matching criteria such as
  - MIME type
  - globs
  - path relative to Git
- generate `tree`-like output for subdirectories
- parse Git metadata for importance rules

If you want to help implement any of these features, please submit a PR. `pls`
is free and open-source software that could use [your help](../contributing).
