# Importance

Not all files and folders in a directory are equally important. This is
especially true for modern software development, where the root folder of a
project is filled with scaffolding and configuration files for toolchains.

Consider this root directory of `pls` itself.

```:no-line-numbers
dist
justfile
LICENSE
poetry.lock
pyproject.toml
README.md
readme_assets
src
tests
```

It's very difficult to identify your source code in this mess. Here's how `pls`
formats it.

```:no-line-numbers
$ pls
```

<div
    style="background-color: #002b36; color: #839496;"
    class="language-">
  <pre style="color: inherit;"><code style="color: inherit;"><span style="color: #156667; text-decoration-color: #156667"></span>  <span style="color: #156667; text-decoration-color: #156667"> dist/</span>

</div>

Notice how `dist/` and `poetry.lock` fade into the background. Also notice how
`src/` appears bold. This is the importance scale, and it makes it easy to find
your proverbial needle in the haystack.

## Options

Files with importance -2 and lower are hidden. They can be made visible using
the `--all`/`-a` flag. Each usage of the flag lowers the visibility threshold by
one, so

- use the flag once to see importance -2 and above

```:no-line-numbers
$ pls -all
$ pls -a
```

- use the flag twice to see importance -3 and above

```:no-line-numbers
$ pls --all --all
$ pls -a -a
$ pls -aa
```

## Configuration

Out of the box, `pls` configures an importance of -1 for the autogenerated code
such as lockfiles for package managers.

- Python

  - `poetry.lock`
  - `Pipfile.lock`
  - `env/`
  - `venv/`

- JavaScript

  - `package-lock.json`
  - `yarn.lock`
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml`
  - `node_modules/`

- Ruby
  - `Gemfile.lock`
  - `vendor`
  - `bundle`

Some especially useless files are bestowed the importance of -2.

- `.DS_Store`
- Python
  - `__pycache__`

## Customisation

To configure file importance, you can do either of the following.

- Extend the configuration locally using a local `.pls.yml` file.  
  For the majority of use cases, this is the preferred option. Using `pls`'s
  powerful extensibility, you can define the importance of the files and folders
  inside your projects (among other things).

- Make a pull-request to `pls`.  
  This only applies if the file type is fairly common and the inclusion of the
  config adds value for a lot of developers. The `pls` OOBE is intentionally
  minimal.

## Reference

The importance of files is classified into 5 levels.

| Level | Significance       | Appearance        |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| -2    | Least important    | Hidden by default |
| -1    | Lower importance   | Dimmed            |
| 0     | Neutral importance | Normal            |
| +1    | Higher importance  | Bold              |
| +2    | Most important     | Underline         |

If any spec sets the importance of a file, it takes precedence over the default.
The default importance of a file is determined on the basis of two factors:

- whether the file has any spec associated with it
- whether the file name starts with a leading dot `.`

| Has spec | Leading `.` | Default importance |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| No       | No          | 0                  |
| Yes      | No          | 0                  |
| No       | Yes         | -2                 |
| Yes      | Yes         | -1                 |

Files without a leading dot have a default importance of 0. Files with a leading
dot have importance -1 if they have a matching spec or -2 if they don't.
