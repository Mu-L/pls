# Icons

Icons in `pls` are abstracted one level above the raw codepoints to allow
switching the icon between Nerd Font icons and emojis.

Icons are simply mappings of icon names and the corresponding glyph.

## Nerd Font icons

The keys in this dictionary are icon names and the values are Unicode code
points corresponding to the icon. These can be obtained from the
[Nerd Fonts cheat sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet). See the hex
code at the bottom right of your preferred icon and prefix `\u` to it.

```yml
nerd_icons:
  lock: "\uf023" # nf-fa-lock
  key: "\uf80a" # nf-mdi-key_variant
```

::: warning
YAML has weird rules for strings. To ensure everything works as expected, wrap
the unicode escape codes in double quotes `"`.
:::

::: tip
Since it's basically impossible to mentally associate a code point with the
visual, you should put the actual class name in a comment for future reference.
:::

::: tip
You can also set your IDE font to a Nerd Font, and then just copy-paste the icon
glyph directly from the Nerd Fonts site.

## Emoji icons

The keys in this dictionary are icon names and the values are the actual emoji
glyph.

```yml
emoji_icons:
  lock: "üîí"
  key: "üîë"
```

Compared to Nerd Font icons, emoji icons have fewer quirks. But they aren't as
aesthetic for several reasons.

- Emojis lack color consistency as they are all inherently colorful. This also
  prevents them from being colored using the spec `color` like text.
- Technology specific icons are largely absent from the set, leaving little to
  no choice of icons and forcing use of metaphors (like üêç for Python).
