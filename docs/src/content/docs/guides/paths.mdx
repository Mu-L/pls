import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import { Content as FilesAndDirs } from "@/examples/files_and_dirs/files_and_dirs.mdx";
import { Content as OuterConf } from "@/examples/file_group/outer.mdx";
import { Content as InnerConf } from "@/examples/file_group/inner.mdx";
import { Content as FileGroup } from "@/examples/file_group/file_group.mdx";
import { Content as Symlinks } from "@/examples/symlinks/symlinks.mdx";
import { Content as Destination } from "@/examples/symlinks/destination.mdx";

First <Pls /> organises paths supplied as CLI arguments into groups of solo
files and individual directories. Then it prints each group one by one.

```console
$ pls README.md Cargo.toml Cargo.lock src docs
```

<FilesAndDirs />

## Solo files

The solo files group consists of all files supplied individually. These files
are collected into one group. Each of the files in this group comes with its own
separate configuration derived from `.pls.yml` files.

The special thing here is that the group also has its own configuration
determined from the common ancestor of all these files. This group-level
configuration sets top-level options such as table headings, box-drawing
characters and importance scales.

Consider the following filesystem tree:

```
file_group
├── .pls.yml
├── a
└── subdir
    ├── .pls.yml
    └── b
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="file_group/.pls.yml">
    <OuterConf />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="file_group/subdir/.pls.yml">
    <InnerConf />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```console
$ pls a ./../file_group/./subdir/a
```

<FileGroup />

Note how both files retain their individual configurations for the row, but the
table settings come from the outer `.pls.yml` file. Also note that the file
names are shown exactly as they were passed on the command line.

## Symlinks

By default, <Pls /> does not follow symlinks in the arguments provided to it. So
a symlink to a directory will be treated as a file input and will not list the
contents of the target directory.

```console
$ pls sym
```

<Symlinks />

```console
$ pls ./dir
```

<Destination />
