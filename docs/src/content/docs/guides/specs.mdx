title: Specs
descriptions:
  Specs are the backbone of pls, enabling it to match individual nodes to style
  rules. This makes pls more powerful than tools that match extensions or types.

At its core, the output of <Pls /> is a list of nodes. Each node in the list has
a specific color, style and importance, all of which collectively determine how
it is rendered and displayed.

<Pls /> uses specs to match each node to its visual properties, using a powerful
regex matching system, which allows nodes to be matched by their name, extension
or even fragments of both.

## Spec

A spec consists of four components, of which only the first is mandatory.

- **pattern:**
  [`regex::bytes::Regex`](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/bytes/struct.Regex.html)

  This is a regex pattern that will be compared against the node name. If the
  node matches this regex, this spec will be associated with the node.

- **icon:** `String`

  This is the name, and not the actual glyph, of the [icon](/pls/features/icons)
  to use for nodes matching this spec. When specs cascade, the last defined icon
  definition is used. If no specs match a node, the default icon for the node
  type is used.

- **style:** `String`

  This is a [markup](/pls/guides/markup) directive that must be applied to the
  nodes that match this spec. When specs cascade, their directives are combined
  with latter rules overriding previous ones if they conflict.

- **importance:** `i8`

  This defines the [importance level](/pls/features/importance/) of the file and
  overrides the default value (determined by the leading dot).

- collapse: [`Collapse`](#collapse)

### Collapse

:::caution

ðŸš§ This feature is a work in progress and will be coming in a future version.

:::

The goal of collapsing is to indicate that a node is a derivative of another
adjacent node. For example, a JS file with the same name as a sibling TS file
likely indicates that it's a transpiled version of the latter. Similarly, a
`Cargo.lock` file is a derived version of `Cargo.toml`.

## Configuration

Specs are configured in the [`.pls.yml` file](/pls/guides/conf/).

### Examples

Consider a typical JavaScript project. When listing it with <Pls /> the output
is very plain. Notice the regular JSON and YAML icons for `package.json` and
`pnpm-lock.yaml`? Notice how files related to Prettier have no icon at all?

```console
$ pls
```

<SpecsDef />

Let's add a spec file to it.

<SpecsConf />

<SpecsConfd />

```console
$ pls src/
```

<SpecsConfdSrc />
