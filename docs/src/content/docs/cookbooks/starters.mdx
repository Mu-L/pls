title: Starter configs
description:
  The USP of pls is that it uses plaintext YAML configurations that can be
  checked into VCS and shared with others. Here are some to get you started.
---

<Pls /> uses simple YAML-based [config files](/pls/reference/conf/). This makes
it easy to

- check these configs into VCS to ensure your teammates can enjoy them
- back them up with the rest of your dotfiles
- share them with others to help them get started

This page consists of some configs to get you started. If you have a config that
you'd like to share with others, [please share](/pls/guides/contribute/) with
us.

## Rust

<Pls /> being a Rust project, comes with the configuration for Rust projects
baked-in.
