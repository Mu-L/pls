title: Starter configs
description:
  The USP of pls is that it uses plaintext YAML configurations that can be
  checked into VCS and shared with others. Here are some to get you started.
---

<Pls /> uses simple YAML-based [config files](/reference/conf/). This makes it
easy to

- check these configs into VCS to ensure your teammates can enjoy them
- back them up with the rest of your dotfiles
- share them with others to help them get started

This page consists of some configs to get you started. If you have a config that
you'd like to share with others, [please share](/guides/contribute/) with us.

## Common files

Since <Pls /> comes with a very minimal configuration out-of-the-box, you can
use this to set up <Pls /> for most common file types.

```yaml
icons:
  pdf: "" # nf-seti-pdf
  image: "" # nf-oct-image
  audio: "" # nf-seti-audio
  video: "" # nf-oct-video
  text: "" # nf-seti-text
  table: "󰓫" # nf-md-table
specs:
  - pattern: \.pdf$
    icons:
      - pdf
  - pattern: \.(txt|rtf)$
    icons:
      - text
  - pattern: \.(csv|tsv)$
    icons:
      - table
  - pattern: \.(mp3|wav|aac)$
    icons:
      - audio
  - pattern: \.(png|jpg|bmp|webp)$

```

pretty and consistent icons for all your work files.

  - pattern: \.xlsx?$
    icons:
      - excel

      - powerpoint
```

## Rust

<Pls /> being a Rust project, comes with the configuration for Rust projects
baked-in.

## Python

If you build Python projects using Pipenv, Poetry or PDM, this config is for
you.

```yaml
icons:
  python: "" # nf-seti-python
specs:
  - pattern: \.py$
    icons:
      - python
    style: rgb(255,212,59)
  - pattern: requirements.*\.txt$
    icons:
      - lock

    icons:
      - lock
    importance: -1
    collapse:
      name: pyproject.toml
  - pattern: ^Pipfile.lock$
    icons:
      - lock
    importance: -1
    collapse:
      name: Pipfile
```

## Web development

If you build web applications without any of the major JavaScript frameworks,
this config is for you.

```yaml

## JavaScript/TypeScript

npm and pnpm as package managers, and Vue and React frameworks as well. If you
use JavaScript for frontend development, you should also inherit the web dev
config above.
