title: Comparison
description:
  There are many alternatives to ls(1) but pls is unique in its target
  demographic of pro users and its focus on customisation.
---

<Pls /> has the distinction of being an `ls(1)` replacement specifically
targeted a a pro audience. This leads to different motivations, different
decisions, different choices and different defaults. This also gives us the
advantage of being able to provide features that are powerful but complex.

There are other `ls(1)` alternatives that have been around for longer and have
sizeable user bases.

<Pls /> strives to provide all the features expected from these tools, and more.
For an idea, here is a comparison between <Pls /> and the most popular
alternative, [exa](https://the.exa.website).

## Pros

- exa hides files with a leading dot by default, an approach it inherits from
  `ls(1)`. <Pls /> dims or hides files based on their
  [importance](/pls/features/importance/), making it suitable for modern dev
  workflows involving tooling configs.

- exa uses arcane environment variables for customisation. <Pls /> uses
  [cascading YAML files](/pls/guides/conf/) to enable per-project configuration
  that's also more readable, maintainable and ergonomic. You can also check
  these config files into your VCS and share them with your team.

- exa uses globs which limits the match to simple queries. <Pls /> uses
  [specs](/pls/guides/specs/) which match files using the full power of regex
  and then provide both styling and [icons](/pls/features/icons/) for their
  matches. These specs can also be cascaded.

- exa output is very colorful, but limited to customisation using ANSI escape
  codes. <Pls /> employs sparse color and formatting, to add meaning or context,
  and these [styles](/pls/guides/markup/) can be customised using English names
  or even RGB notation.

- <Pls /> has more [metadata fields](/pls/features/detail_view/) compared to
  exa. It also allows the user to view some metadata fields in multiple ways
  (including simultaneously), which exa cannot do.

- exa provides filtering by glob matches and sorting by one field. <Pls />
  provides filtering (by [regex](/pls/features/name_filter/) or
  [type](/pls/features/type_filter/)) and [sorting](/pls/features/sorting) (by
  multiple selections out of over 18 bases &times; 2 directions).

- exa can dim a small list of generated files. <Pls /> has a much more powerful
  [collapse](/pls/features/collapse/) feature that can render generated files
  differently and can be extended with specs.

- exa defaults to no icons, grid view, files mixed with folders and sorting by
  name. <Pls /> defaults to showing icons, list view, folders listed first and
  leading dots aligned and sorting by canonical name.

- exa, being a mature project, moves very slowly. <Pls /> is new and actively in
  developed, which is why it iterates fast and pushes releases more often.

## Cons

- exa's interface is much more compatible with `ls(1)` in the base case. A lot
  of `ls(1)` options map 1:1 with exa. <Pls /> does not care for option
  compatibility with `ls(1)` at all.

- exa is a mature product with a large contributor base. <Pls /> is a young
  project with a [novice ðŸ¦€ Rustacean maintainer](https://dhruvkb.dev/).
  Contributions, both in [code](https://github.com/dhruvkb/pls) and as
  [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/dhruvkb), are welcome!

- The spec system <Pls /> uses might be slow when listing lots of files due to
  its Cartesian product complexity. Also, <Pls /> lacks the speed optimisations
  that a mature tool like exa has built over time.

- exa can show if a file has extended attributes. <Pls /> opted not to do this
  because it's not a common use case.

- exa has a long grid view (which is a combination of <Pls />'s
  [detail](/pls/features/detail_view/) and [grid](/pls/features/grid_view/)
  views) that <Pls /> [does not yet have](/pls/features/upcoming/).

- exa has a tree mode that <Pls /> [does not yet have](/pls/features/upcoming/).

- exa supports Windows which <Pls /> [does not yet do](/pls/about/faq/).
