<Pls /> is constantly evolving with new features added, existing ones refined
and bugs fixed. We have bold plans for <Pls /> to make it the best `ls(1)`
alternative out there. To that end, here are some features that <Pls /> could
support soon.

- Git integration

  Git integration is coming soon and will enable the following sub-features:

  - `.gitignore` parsing for [importance](/pls/features/importance/) levels
  - Git status codes in the [detail view](/pls/features/detail_view/) with
    `--det=git`

- Feature parity

  We are working on bringing feature parity between <Pls /> and
  [its competition](/pls/about/comparison/).

To make these features a reality, we need your help. If you are interested in
contributing to <Pls />, please see the
[contribution guide](/pls/guides/contribute/).
