title: Type filter
description:
  pls provides a way to filter the contents by node type which, combined with
  the name filter, makes it easier to find what you are searching for.

import { Content as TypeFilterOff } from "@/examples/type_filter/off.mdx";
import { Content as TypeFilterOn } from "@/examples/type_filter/on.mdx";
import { Content as TypeFilterDis } from "@/examples/type_filter/dis.mdx";

<Pls /> allows the user to only list specific node types in the output.

## Arguments

`--typ`/`-t` can be used to select the node types the user wants to see. The
flag can be specified multiple times to enable multiple file types. Each time it
can take one of these values.

| Value        | Description                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| dir          | regular folder                |
| symlink      | symbolic link                 |
| fifo         | named pipe                    |
| socket       | file-based socket             |
| block_device | block special device file     |
| char_device  | character special device file |
| file         | regular file                  |
| none         | **shorthand:** no node types  |
| all          | **shorthand:** all node types |

:::caution

Type filtering is not applicable when listing a specific node.

### Mechanism

When parsing the `--typ`/`-t` flag, values are read from the CLI, in order, and
added to a vector of node types till we encounter a shorthand value. If the
shorthand value is `none`, the vector is cleared. If the shorthand value is
`all`, the vector is filled with all the node types.

For example, consider the <Pls /> invocation below.

```bash
pls --typ=symlink --typ=all --typ=none --typ=dir
```

- `symlink` is added to the list.
- All the file types are added to the list, including the already existing
  `symlink`.
- All entries so far are dropped when `none` is encountered.
- `dir` is added to the list.

The final set contains only `dir` and so <Pls /> will only list the directories.

### Examples

```bash
pls # or --typ=all or --t=all
```

<TypeFilterOff />

```bash
pls --typ=dir --typ=symlink # or -t=dir -t=symlink
```

<TypeFilterOn />

```bash
pls --typ=dir --typ=symlink fifo # `--typ` has no effect
```

<TypeFilterDis />
