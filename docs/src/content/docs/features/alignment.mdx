<Pls /> performs slight tweaks to alignment to account for leading dots. When
alignment is enabled, the leading dots are moved one position to the left, so
that the actual file names are aligned. Also the leading dots are slightly
dimmed to reduce their visual prominence.

## Arguments

`--align`/`-a` can be used to turn alignment on or off. File names are aligned
by default because usually it's the name that's important.

### Examples

```bash
pls # or --align=true or -a=true
```

<AlignmentOn />

```bash
pls --align=false # or -a=false
```

<AlignmentOff />
