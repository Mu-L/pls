  pls shows helpful headers for columns in the detail view and enables users to
  customise the text and style of these headers.

import { Content as HeaderOn } from "@/examples/header/on.mdx";
import { Content as HeaderOff } from "@/examples/header/off.mdx";

<Pls /> shows headers above columns to help understand the output better. If not
set, these headers intelligently appear when they are needed.

## Arguments

`--header`/`-H` can be used to turn headers on or off. It is turned on by
default if the details view is enabled.

:::caution

This flag has no effect unless the [detail view](/pls/features/detail_view/) is
enabled with `--det`/`-d`.

:::

### Examples

```console
$ pls --det=std # or --header=true or -H=true
```

<HeaderOn />

```console
$ pls --det=std --header=false # or -H=false
```

<HeaderOff />

## Configuration

Using the configuration system, you can modify the column headers and change
their appearance using styling rules.

See the [detail view configuration](/pls/features/detail_view#configuration) for
an example.
