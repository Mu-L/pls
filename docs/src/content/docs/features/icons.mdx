<Pls /> shows pretty and helpful icons next to files by default. These icons can
help when visually searching for a specific type of file.

## Arguments

`--icon`/`-i` can be used to turn icons on or off. Icons are shown by default
because they're so pretty and helpful.

### Examples

```bash
pls # or --icon=true or -i=true
```

<IconsOn />

```bash
pls --icon=false # or -i=false
```

<IconsOff />

## Configuration

Using the configuration system, you can add more icons, in addition to the
default set included with <Pls />, and change the default glyphs of built-in
icons.

Icons are defined in two steps.

1. Map an icon name to a glyph.

   If you map a built-in name, you can change default glyphs shown by <Pls />
   for that node. You can use the
   [Nerd Fonts reference](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) to find your
   preferred icons.

2. Associate file name patterns to icon names.

   Refer to the [specs guide](/guides/specs/) to learn how to do that.

<Pls /> shows a default icon for some file types (like directory and symlink)
but comes with dormant mappings for every file type. See the example below for
how to enable the default icon or use a custom one.

### Examples

<IconsConf />

<IconsConfd />
