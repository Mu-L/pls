title: Name filter
description:
  pls provides a way to filter the contents by regex matching on names,
  providing a way to exclude, or only include, certain names.

import { Content as NameFilterOn } from "@/examples/name_filter/on.mdx";
import { Content as NameFilterOff } from "@/examples/name_filter/off.mdx";
import { Content as NameFilterDis } from "@/examples/name_filter/dis.mdx";

<Pls /> allows the user to filter the contents by regex matching on names. Name
matching can be used to exclude the names that match a certain pattern or only
include the names that match a certain pattern. Both can be used in tandem to
perform very powerful filtering.

## Arguments

`--exclude`/`-e` can be used to remove the files that match the given pattern.
`--only`/`-o` can be used to remove the files that do not match the given
pattern.

:::caution

Specifying both `--only`/`-o` and `--exclude`/`-e` will limit <Pls /> to only
showing files that simultaneously match both rules.

:::

:::caution

Name filtering is not applicable when listing a specific node.

## Examples

```bash
pls # or --only='.*' --exclude='$^'
```

<NameFilterOff />

```bash
pls --only='(a|c)' --exclude='\.jpe?g$'
```

<NameFilterOn />

```bash
pls --exclude='\.jpe?g$' a.jpg # `--exclude` has no effect
```

<NameFilterDis />
