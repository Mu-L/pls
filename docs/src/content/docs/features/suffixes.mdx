<Pls /> shows suffixes for many common file types. This is usually helpful to
identify file types by just looking at the name. The suffixes are generally
dimmed so as to not appear like they're actually a part of the file name.

## Arguments

`--suffix`/`-S` can be used to turn suffixes on or off. Suffixes are shown by
default because of their utility.

### Examples

```bash
pls # or --suffix=true or -S=true
```

<SuffixesOn />

```bash
pls --suffix=false # or -S=false
```

<SuffixesOff />

## Configuration

Using the configuration system, you can add suffixes for more file types, in
addition to the default set included with <Pls />, and change the existing
suffixes to your liking.

### Examples

<SuffixesConf />

<SuffixesConfd />
