<Pls /> offers the ability to sort the output in your preferred order by
choosing as many as you prefer from 18 bases &times; 2 directions per base.

## Arguments

`--sort`/`-s` can be used to select the sort bases. The flag can be specified
multiple times to sort by multiple bases. Each time it can take one of these
values. All values except `none` can optionally suffixed with an underscore `_`
to reverse their direction.

| ctime  | changed at; originally meant "created at"                         |
| mtime  | modified at                                                       |
| atime  | accessed at                                                       |

| cname  | canonical name (name in lower case with leading symbols stripped) |
| ext    | file extension                                                    |
| none   | **shorthand:** no sorting                                         |

By default, <Pls /> sorts file by `cat` and `cname`, which means

- directories are listed before files (`cat`)
- nodes are sorted by their canonical names (`cname`)

When sorting by multiple sort bases, the first listed basis is the primary sort
basis, the second is the tie-breaker for the first, the third is the tie-breaker
for the second and so on.

:::note

The canonical name of a file is obtained by stripping leading symbols from the
name and then converting it to lowercase.

So the canonical name of the `.DS_Store` file would be 'ds_store'. This name is
helpful when sorting because it allows for dotfiles and case-mixed files to be
sorted along with the other files, instead of being separated out.

### Mechanism

When parsing the `--sort`/`-s` flag, values are read from the CLI, in order, and
added to a vector of sort bases till we encounter the shorthand value `none`,
which clears the vector.

For example, consider the <Pls /> invocation below.

```console
$ pls --sort=cat --sort=cname --sort=none --sort=mtime_
```

- `cat` is added to the list.
- `cname` is added to the list.
- All entries so far are dropped when `none` is encountered.
- `mtime_` is added to the list.

### Examples

```console
$ pls # or --sort=cat --sort=cname or -s=cat -s=cname
```

<SortingDef />

```console
$ pls --det=ino --det=typ --det=size --sort=cat_ --sort=size_ --sort=ino
```

<SortingCust />
